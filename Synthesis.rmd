#13-cis retinoic treatment of human sebocytes (SEB-1) - GSE10432


##Description of the study 
The title of the study is 13-cis retinoic treatment of human sebocytes SEB-1. The organism tested is human. 
The main objective is to study the sebocyte-specific mechanism of action by analyzing the effects of 72 hour 13-cis RA treatment on cultured human sebocyte cells (SEB-1), to gain insight on the pathogenesis of acne
